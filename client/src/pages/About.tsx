      <h3> ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! Iâ€™m Tambiâ€”</h3>A Senior Fullstack Engineer with over 6
      years of experience building scalable, high-performance web applications.
      This site is my personal Learning Hub, where Iâ€™ve distilled best
      practices, deep dives, and real-world examples around Node.js, Express,
      and modern JavaScript tooling. Here youâ€™ll find: In-depth tutorials on
      everything from HTTP request logging with Morgan to advanced stream
      processing, clustering, and production-grade error handling.
      <div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
        Practical guides on securing your APIs with JWT, rate-limiting traffic
        to protect your services, and scaling out via clusters and PM2. Hands-on
        code examples that you can clone, fork, and adaptâ€”whether youâ€™re
        building your first server or optimizing a massive distributed system.
        My goal is to help you master both the fundamentals and the edge cases
        of Node.js. Every topic is crafted from real projects Iâ€™ve ledâ€”so you
        get battle-tested patterns, clear explanations, and actionable snippets
        you can drop straight into your codebase. I hope you enjoy exploring
        these modules as much as I enjoyed writing them. Happy coding!
