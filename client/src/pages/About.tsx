            This site was built by one of us (shout-out to{" "}
            <strong>Tambi ðŸ“£</strong>) to keep you updated on Node.js and
            everything web-related. Here youâ€™ll find:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>In-depth tutorials</strong> on everything from HTTP
              request logging with Morgan to advanced stream processing,
              clustering, and production-grade error handling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Practical guides</strong> on securing your APIs with JWT,
              rate-limiting traffic to protect your services, and scaling out
              via clusters and PM2.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hands-on code examples</strong> you can clone, fork, and
              adaptâ€”whether youâ€™re building your first server or optimizing a
              massive distributed system.

            Our goal is to help you master both the fundamentals and the edge
            cases of Node.js. Every topic is crafted from real projects weâ€™ve
            ledâ€”so you get battle-tested patterns, clear explanations, and
            actionable snippets you can drop straight into your codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope you enjoy exploring these modules as much as we enjoyed
            writing them. Happy coding! ðŸš€
